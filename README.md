# Backend Code Challenge - Plentific

This project represents a web application written in Django. The application is able to seed it's database with CSV files from [here](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4c9b7641-cf73-4fd9-869a-4bfeed6d440e/hm-land-registry-price-paid-data).

### Project Setup

Make sure you have Python `3.8+` installed on your machine.
I recommend to also create a virtual environment in order to isolate project dependencies.

To install project dependencies just run
```
make install
```

After that, check if all the tests are green
```
make test
```
The project uses `black` for code formatting, and to format the code, just run
```
make lint
```
To start the development server on your machine, run
```
make run
```

As I mentioned, the project database needs to be seeded with data. For this, we have a download a CSV file from [here](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4c9b7641-cf73-4fd9-869a-4bfeed6d440e/hm-land-registry-price-paid-data). Any CSV file will do.

After that, just run
```
python manage.py seed_db --file_path=your_path_to_downloaded_file 
```
This command will read the file and will insert all it's contents into the database. All of this is done with the power of SQL ðŸ’ª.

### Endpoints

At the moment, there are only two endpoints available.

 - `/house-prices` is the endpoint where data is grouped by month for each property type.
    
    For filtering of the data, there are a few query params available:
    - `from_date`, a string of the format `YYYY-MM-DD` representing from which date the data should be filtered.
    - `to_date`, a string of the format `YYYY-MM-DD` representing to which date the data should be filtered.
    - `postcode`, a string represending the postcode of the region where the land is located.
 - `/transactions` is the endpoint where transactions are grouped by price range types.
